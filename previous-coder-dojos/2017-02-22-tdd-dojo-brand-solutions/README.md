## TDD Dojo @ Brand Solutions

We organized this for the Brand Solutions department, to improve the knowledge
sharing and encourage people to use TDD in their daily work.

### Katas

 * Leap Years Kata
 * String Calculator Kata
 * Roman Numerals Kata

### Feedback
#### What I learned

 * TDD Refreshed
 * Scala is strange
 * Setup takes time
 * Ping Pong Style
 * Scala .pp
 * Practice TDD
 * Clojure
 * Scala testing
 * Keep the principle of doing test, writing implementation etc
 * Code with someone I never worked with
 * Writing tests upfront is more fun than all at once
 * New languages and features
 * How to use Clojure in Cursive
 * Clojure syntax is more obscure than I thought
 
#### What surprised me
 
 * Working with strangers in strage languages is fun
 * How much time one could spend on setting up environment
 * TDD is cool for pure functions
 * Lots of trying out new languages
 * Ping Pong (pair programming) is cool
 * Ping Pong style
 * Having good test coverage simplifies optmiziations
 * Ping Pong PP style
 * Ping Pong Method
 * How much fun it is
  
#### Different next time
 * Use tools like atomist for project bootstrap
 * Pre-setups envs (projects) in a git repo
 * Don't overthink requirements
 * Prepare project skeleton before hand
 * Prepare setups
 * Haven env prepared, blank projects
 * Bring external keyboards
 * Pick a few languages first and do test setup
 
 
 #### Feedback survey
 
 What did you like? What did you dislike ?
Setup for languages without a bigger tool support took too long
Ping-pong style pair development is great. 
We should have prepared some basic environment setups to speed up process 
I liked working with new colleagues and languages. Pizza was cold.
I liked that we paired with someone from another team, I did not like the fact that the topic of the katas were not announced upfront
I liked everything, and maybe we can make the kata more harder
Like: 
Possibility to work with different people, get tips and tricks of how they code.
Interpreter kata was fun.
Dislike:
Leap year kata is trivial and boring
I REALLY prefer to have pair of 24" displays with cloned screens. Doing pair programming over ONE 13" laptop make people uncomfortable.
40 minutes is too small to achieve anything. I'd like to have 90 minutes and 2 katas
Pairing with people I didn't really know before.
   
   
#### What did you learn, if anything?

Ping Pong Pair Programming. Keeping focus on small tests and enhance them over time to implement more complex logic.
TDD principles refreshed
I learned some nifty tricks for each language I trined
Depending on the team, we have very different coding styles ! Also, it is more fun to code tests upfront rather than all at once at the end.
Ping-Pong way for pair programming, so Scala testing skills
Setting up project from scratch in very tight timeframe can be painful.
Picking new language without person who knows how to use it is waste of time
Cursive for Clojure is cool (thanks Dan)
A bit of clojure and typescript, and that it is sometimes hard to keep your pair in the line and doing small increments.

## What are some topics you would like to explore in the next dojo


Akka Streams, Angular 2 or 4, Mosaic/Tailor
Mocking, and higher level tests.
Event Sourcing - CQRS - Domain Driven Design would be super cool topics, as it is unrelated to any technology and super useful for everyone. Even producers could attend
Not just coding, also measuring code quality and performance
I would like to try working in group of 3 with one 40" screen and drivers with own devices (to have familiar hotkeys, env, ...). Perhaps set up project skeleton and git repo beforehand. Maybe even define balanced group before start.

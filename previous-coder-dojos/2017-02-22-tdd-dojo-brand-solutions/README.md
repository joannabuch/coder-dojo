### Feedback
#### What I learned

 * TDD Refreshed
 * Scala is strange
 * Setup takes time
 * Ping Pong Style
 * Scala .pp
 * Practice TDD
 * Clojure
 * Scala testing
 * Keep the principle of doing test, writing implementation etc
 * Code with someone I never worked with
 * Writing tests upfront is more fun than all at once
 * New languages and features
 * How to use Clojure in Cursive
 * Clojure syntax is more obscure than I thought
 
#### What surprised me
 
 * Working with strangers in strage languages is fun
 * How much time one could spend on setting up environment
 * TDD is cool for pure functions
 * Lots of trying out new languages
 * Ping Pong (pair programming) is cool
 * Ping Pong style
 * Having good test coverage simplifies optmiziations
 * Ping Pong PP style
 * Ping Pong Method
 * How much fun it is
  
#### Different next time
 * Use tools like atomist for project bootstrap
 * Pre-setups envs (projects) in a git repo
 * Don't overthink requirements
 * Prepare project skeleton before hand
 * Prepare setups
 * Haven env prepared, blank projects
 * Bring external keyboards
 * Pick a few languages first and do test setup
